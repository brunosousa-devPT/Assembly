# Maze Game Assembly x86


This is a game made in assembly x86 for a project at college. 
Basically, you have an Avatar and a maze full of letters and you have to find the whole word in a limit amount of time.
There's multiple levels and they have the same maze but different words and limit time. This was a variant that we need to respect for the project.

This program runs well in DosBox.

I know the programming is not good, but this was literally my first project in assembly x86.

I might improve this game or just create a better version of it.
